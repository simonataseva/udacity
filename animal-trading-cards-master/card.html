			<p>The Bichon Frise breed is one of the most obedient and smartest dogs, which combines a playful enthusiasm and an adventurous spirit. Preserving its love for hunting, it is fond of swimming, running, and retrieving. Although it is shy with strangers, it gets along with familiar people and is very good with children.</p>
